# school-finder-android
The school finder application.

Currently the school finder enables users to browse and filter schools listed on the school finder database. The schools can be viewed on a map (currently only on Google Maps) or browsed through on a list.

The filters include:
- Keyword search
- Location (city/town)
- Public and / or private schools
- Available positions for learners

The data for the schools is pulled from a Firebase database, which was manually populated, thus the current data might not be completely accurate. The data for available positions was randomized.
